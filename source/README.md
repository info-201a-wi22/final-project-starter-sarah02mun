# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into 
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[Chart 1 - map](../source/chart1.R) | This is a map chart that displays the minimum wage for 2020 across all 50 states. 
|[Chart 2 - line chart](../source/chart2.R) | This is a line chart which shows the change in minimum wage and average CPI between 1968 and 2020.
|[Chart 3 - scatter plots](../source/chart3.R) | This chart shows a series of scatter plots summarizing minimum wage for all states between 1968 and 2020



# DEVELOPER NOTE 1: About ... 
* All source code for your projects should go in the `/source` directory
* To organize your code, you might decide to create sub-directories, which is fine.
* If you use sub-directories, plese briefly describe them

# DEVELOPER NOTE 2:  Clear and Concise Documentation
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore, 
aim for clarity and conciseness.
* When done, be sure to delete these NOTE sections and the example CSV file (which are intended for you, of course, not your audience!)
